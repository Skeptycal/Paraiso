(Vector v, Ring.C g) seems to be unnecessary in many positions.
let us try removing them.

names must be strictly qualified.
Exceptions are internal modules (Language.Paraiso.*) and base.

let us make Language.Paraiso.Prelude include fundamental abstraction
modules, upto Traversable. and let Language.Paraiso.Prelude hide their
lesser counterparts from Prelude.
